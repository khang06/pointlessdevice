Cursed savestate solution for Touhou games (alternatively: what happens when you buy Ultramarine Orb Elixir from the gas station)

Thanks [@zero318](https://github.com/zero318) for saving me from having to write a ton of hacky assembly for the WoW64 allocation stuff.

## Issues
* Loading savestates between different attempts or stages will crash
* EoSD: Loading savestates between BGM changes will crash unless BGM is off
* BGM in general is very broken
* The game will crash because it feels like it
